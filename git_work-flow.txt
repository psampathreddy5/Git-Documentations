=> In the git we have to know some topics before working in he git 
----------------------
a) COMMIT
b) CLONE
c) TRACKING/UNTRACKING
d) BRANCH
-----------------------
=> above are the basic and important topics we need to understand.

a). Commit :-
-------------
			Here when ever we store a code in any folder on on any system
we give some meta data like author, created on , developer team , and some data
and by this meta data we will know the details of this files.
b). Clone :-
-------------
			Clone is nothin but a copy , like we need to copy entire code of another 
developer and u need to work on that and we will update.
c). Tracking/Untracking :-
---------------------------
			This will track the files thare are present in the repository
